# typescript-oauth-server

The **headless OAuth/OIDC Authorization Server** in the *Externalized Login & Consent* pattern. A thin client of [Authlete 3.0](https://www.authlete.com/) on the inside, a standard OAuth/OIDC surface on the outside, with login and consent handed off to a separate UI (`auth-ui`).

Built on **TypeScript · Hono · `@authlete/typescript-sdk`**.

> This is the AS half of the pair. **The AS is headless** — every screen a user sees during sign-in or consent is rendered by `auth-ui`. The AS only owns protocol endpoints and the redirect back to the RP.

## Externalized Login & Consent Pattern

**Intent.** Decouple user authentication and consent from the OAuth/OIDC Authorization Server. The AS stays a thin, spec-compliant surface; a separate UI application (`auth-ui`) owns everything the user touches. The AS holds no per-transaction state.

### Roles

| Component | Responsibility | What it sees |
|---|---|---|
| **Relying Party (RP)** | Initiates `/authorize`; receives code/tokens. | Only the AS. |
| **Authorization Server (AS) — this repo** | OAuth/OIDC endpoints (`/authorize`, `/token`, `/userinfo`, `/par`, `/introspect`, `/revoke`, `/jwks`, `.well-known/*`). Delegates user-facing flow to `auth-ui`; owns the final redirect back to the RP. | RP, Authlete, `auth-ui` — never external IdPs. |
| **auth-ui** | Authenticates the user with any combination of factors (password, MFA, passkeys, federation); collects consent; records the decision against the opaque interaction ticket. | Only the opaque ticket id — no codes, no tokens, no RP `redirect_uri`s. |
| **Authlete** | OAuth/OIDC protocol engine. Owns per-transaction state via tickets. | Never reachable from the browser; only the AS calls it. |

### State model

- The **Authlete ticket** is the only handle for an in-flight authorization. Auth result, consent decision, and request context all hang off it.
- The **AS holds no per-transaction state**. The browser carries only the ticket id; the AS exchanges it back for context as needed. (One transitional exception is documented inline in `src/userstore.ts`.)
- `auth-ui` holds the user session but not the OAuth transaction.

### Trust boundaries

```
 ┌──────────┐    OAuth / OIDC    ┌──────────┐  interaction protocol   ┌──────────┐
 │   RP     │ ─────────────────→ │    AS    │ ───(bearer-auth)──────→ │ auth-ui  │
 └──────────┘                    │  (this)  │                          │          │
                                 │          │   @authlete/sdk          │          │
                                 │          │ ─────────────────→  Authlete         │
                                 └──────────┘                          └─────┬────┘
                                                                             │
                                                  (future) federated IdPs · MFA · passkeys
```

- **AS outward to RPs**: standard OAuth/OIDC. One spec, no surprises.
- **AS ↔ auth-ui**: the [Interaction Protocol](./INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md) — a bilateral signed-JWT contract for handing off the user-facing flow and exchanging state. Two channel modes (back-channel for production, front-channel for dev/test).
- **AS ↔ Authlete**: standard Authlete SDK over HTTPS.
- **AS never federates outward.** No social login, no upstream OIDC, no SAML. All of that lives in `auth-ui`.

### Why this pattern

- **Implementation-portable.** A thin Authlete client with no user state can be this Node service, a sidecar, a reverse-proxy plugin, or live inside an API gateway / edge worker.
- **Authentication grows in `auth-ui`.** MFA, passkeys, federation, step-up, risk-based prompts — none of which the AS ever sees.
- **Consent grows in `auth-ui`.** Granular per-claim choices, Rich Authorization Requests (RAR), persistent grant management — all UI work behind the same ticket interface.
- **Independent deploy and scale.** Two services, one narrow protocol between them.

This separation matches the architecture Authlete is designed around: the engine owns the spec and per-transaction state; you own the user experience.

## Endpoints

| Path | Spec | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET/POST /oauth/authorize` | OAuth 2.0, OIDC Core | Authorization endpoint — redirects to the interaction app for login + consent. |
| `POST /oauth/token` | RFC 6749 §3.2 | Token endpoint — `authorization_code`, `refresh_token`, `client_credentials`. |
| `GET/POST /oauth/userinfo` | OIDC Core §5.3 | UserInfo endpoint. |
| `POST /oauth/par` | RFC 9126 | Pushed Authorization Requests. |
| `POST /oauth/introspect` | RFC 7662 | Token introspection. |
| `POST /oauth/revoke` | RFC 7009 | Token revocation. |
| `POST /api/register` | RFC 7591 | Dynamic Client Registration. |
| `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/register/{id}` | RFC 7592 | Client registration management (read / update / delete). |
| `GET /oauth/jwks` | RFC 7517 | Service JWK Set (merges Authlete-managed keys + the AS's own interaction-protocol signing key). |
| `GET /.well-known/openid-configuration` | OIDC Discovery | OIDC discovery metadata. |
| `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` | RFC 8414 | OAuth AS metadata. |
| `GET  /api/authorizations/{id}` | [Interaction Protocol](./INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md) | Interaction app fetches in-flight authorization state (JWT-bearer auth). |
| `POST /api/authorizations/{id}/decision` | [Interaction Protocol](./INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md) | Interaction app submits the user's decision (JWT-bearer auth). |
| `GET  /authorizations/{id}/resume` | [Interaction Protocol](./INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md) | Browser returns here from the interaction app; the AS calls Authlete `issue`/`fail` and redirects the RP. |

## Interaction protocol

The AS hands off all user-facing interactions (sign-in, consent, MFA, …) to a separate interaction app over the **Interaction Protocol** — a bilateral signed-JWT contract.

- Full spec: **[`INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md`](./INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md)** — JWT envelope, verification rules, channel modes (back-channel for production, front-channel for dev/test), URL surface, per-operation claim shapes.
- Endpoints this AS exposes for the protocol are listed in the **Endpoints** table above.
- Authentication is per-request signed JWT in `Authorization: Bearer`. Each peer publishes a JWKS; each verifies the other's signatures against the published keyset. No OAuth-client registration is used by this protocol.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AUTHLETE_BASE_URL` | Authlete cluster URL (default `https://us.authlete.com`). |
| `AUTHLETE_SERVICE_ID` | Numeric service id from the Authlete console. |
| `AUTHLETE_API_TOKEN` | Service access token from the Authlete console. |
| `AS_BASE_URL` | This server's public URL (RPs and `auth-ui` use it). |
| `AUTH_UI_URL` | Where `auth-ui` is reachable. |
| `PORT` | Listen port (default `3000`). |
| `AS_CORS_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated allowlist of browser origins (e.g. Authlete OAuth Playground). Empty disables CORS. |

## Provisioning (one-time, per Authlete service)

1. Sign up at https://us.authlete.com and create a new Authlete 3.0 service.
2. Register a test RP client in the service (Authorization Code + PKCE) for end-to-end testing.
3. Generate an ES256 key pair for the AS's interaction-protocol signing. Register the public JWK with the Authlete service's JWKS (so it shows up in `/oauth/jwks`); keep the private JWK in this AS's env as `AS_SIGNING_JWKS`.
4. Populate the AS's `.env` from the Authlete console (service id + API token + URLs).
5. The interaction app needs its own ES256 key pair and JWKS publication — see its own setup docs.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in the values above
npm run dev
```

Server boots at `http://localhost:3000`. Health probe:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

Discovery sanity:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/.well-known/openid-configuration | jq .
```

End-to-end is exercised by `auth-ui`'s smoke harness (`auth-ui/scripts/smoke-e2e.mjs`).

## Deploy to Vercel

The server is a Hono app with a `default` export, which Vercel runs with zero
configuration — each route becomes a Vercel Function. The AS holds no
per-transaction state, so it maps cleanly onto serverless.

1. Import the GitHub repo into a Vercel project once. Every push then builds and
   deploys automatically, with a preview URL per pull request.
2. Set the environment variables from the table above in the Vercel project
   (there is no `.env` file in a deployment). `AS_SIGNING_JWKS` must be the same
   private JWKS whose public counterpart is registered with Authlete.
3. Set `AS_BASE_URL` to your stable production domain — it is the issuer identity
   and must match what is registered with the Authlete service. Preview
   deployments fall back to their per-deploy `VERCEL_URL` automatically, so leave
   `AS_BASE_URL` unset in the Preview environment if you want previews to
   self-configure.

`vercel.json` pins the functions to a US region (`iad1`) to keep latency to the
Authlete US cluster low; adjust it for your cluster.

## Federation mode (advanced)

The AS also supports [OpenID Federation 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html), letting it act as a federation-participating OpenID Provider under a trust anchor. **This is opt-in** — operators who don't enable it on the Authlete service never see federation behavior; the routes return `404` and the discovery doc doesn't advertise them.

### What it adds

Two new endpoints, paths matching [java-oauth-server](https://github.com/authlete/java-oauth-server):

| Path | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /.well-known/openid-federation` | GET | Signed **entity configuration** (entity statement JWT) declaring the OP's metadata, JWKS, and `authority_hints`. |
| `POST /api/federation/register` | POST | **Explicit client registration.** Accepts either `application/entity-statement+jwt` (the RP's entity configuration) or `application/trust-chain+json` (a JSON array of entity statement JWTs). |

**Automatic registration** is fully transparent — when an RP arrives at `/oauth/authorize` with a federation entity ID as `client_id`, Authlete validates the trust chain inline and registers the client. No additional AS-side code.

The `.well-known/openid-configuration` document automatically gains the federation fields (`federation_registration_endpoint`, `client_registration_types_supported`, `signed_jwks_uri`, etc.) when federation is enabled on the Authlete service.

### Enabling it

All configuration lives on the **Authlete service** — the AS picks it up automatically with no env changes. In the Authlete console:

1. **Client Registration** tab — enable Federation Support; check `Automatic`, `Explicit`, or both; set Registration Endpoint to `<AS_BASE_URL>/api/federation/register`.
2. **Entity Configuration** tab — set Organization Name; add Authority Hints (the trust anchor's entity ID); optionally set Configuration Duration.
3. **Trust Anchors** tab — add each trust anchor as `{ Entity Identifier, JWKS }`.
4. **Federation JWKS** — supply an ES256 keypair for signing entity statements.

## Roadmap

The AS surface grows with the OAuth/OIDC spec; authentication features grow in `auth-ui`.

### OAuth/OIDC surface

- **FAPI 2.0** — DPoP, JAR, JARM (PAR already shipped).
- **mTLS client auth** (`tls_client_auth`).
- **CIBA** (`urn:openid:params:grant-type:ciba`).
- **RP-Initiated Logout / Front- and Back-channel Logout**.
- **Grants Management API**.

### Interaction protocol

- **Per-claim consent forwarding** — plumb `consentedClaims` end-to-end at `/auth/authorization/issue` so `/userinfo` honors precisely what the user agreed to release (see the `TODO(claims-leakage)` block in `src/routes/userinfo.ts`).
- **Front-channel transport implementation** — JWT-via-browser-redirect carrier for dev/test deployments where the interaction app isn't directly reachable from the AS. Contract is already specified in [`INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md`](./INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md); only back-channel is shipped today.
